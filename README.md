cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your values
```

Required environment variables:
```
# OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENA_AI_PROJECT_ID=your_open_ai_project_id

# Vercel KV (for rate limiting and cache in vercel edge env)
KV_REST_API_URL=http://localhost:8079
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=example_token
```

## Development

1. Start the application:
```bash
make up
```
This will start both the Redis container and the Next.js development server.

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Shutting Down

To stop the application:
```bash
make down
```
This will stop both the Redis container and the Next.js development server.

## üéØ Your Task

Your mission is to transform this chatbot into an extraordinary conversational agent. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Onboarding Questions**: Develop a feature to ask users three onboarding questions:
   - What is their favorite country?
   - What is their favorite continent?
   - What is their favorite destination?

2. **General Purpose Chatbot**: Post-onboarding, the chatbot should be capable of answering questions related to world geography.

3. **Creativity and Architecture**: We are looking for innovative solutions, creative flair, and robust architectural decisions. This task should take at least 1 hour, but feel free to invest more time to enhance the chatbot's capabilities.

## üìã Additional Notes

- Utilize environment variables from `.env.example` (OpenAI Keys for this project).
- Implement a streaming chatbot for the chat rendered in `page.tsx` using the `/api/stream` endpoint.
- Leverage OpenAI npm packages, adhere to best practices, and incorporate your own design and functionality ideas.
- Use the GPT 4.1 model.
- Ensure the chat can onboard users, allow them to change preferences, and engage in informative conversations. (No database needed; mock data is sufficient.)

## ‚ú® Current Features

- **Next.js** (App Router) running on **Node 22.15.0**
- **TypeScript** with `strict` mode enabled
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI styling
- Fixed bottom-right chatbox component
- `/api/stream` **Edge** route that streams an echo response ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Stub for integrating an **OpenAI Assistant** to add side-effects (analytics, logging, etc.)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Best Practice Guidance

1. Use strict TypeScript with ESLint (`typescript-eslint`).
2. Opt for Edge runtime to reduce latency on the streaming route.
3. Manage environment variables via `env.example` (ignored by Git).

## üìß Completion
